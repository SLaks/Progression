Progression is an open-source library for reporting progress.

##Features

 - **Clean design** &ndash; Progression encourages strict separation between functions in the business layer that report progress, and UI code that displays the progress.

 - **Flexible** &ndash; Progression includes a number of built-in progress reporters suitable for most situtations.  If they don't suit your needs, you can [create your own](https://github.com/SLaks/Progression/wiki/Extending-the-Library).

 - **Robust** &ndash; Progression includes more than 75 unit tests to make sure that every part of the library works correctly.

 - **Documented** &ndash; Every public and protected type and member includes a descriptive XML comment.  There are no exceptions to this [rule](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zk18c1w9.aspx).

 - **Well-designed** &ndash; Progression passes Visual Studio's [Code Analysis warnings](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee1hzekz.aspx).
